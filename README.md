# dime-tic-tac-toe

A simple game that is based on the ususal tic-tac-toe game but with few changes.
It has 3 coins for each player, after using which a player can shift there already placed coins either horizontally or vertically.
This game thus can never result in a draw.

Currently it has only two player mode (pvp). 
Soon I will be adding player vs computer mode which requires AI to train the model to play.
